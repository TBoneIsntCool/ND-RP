# Staff Guide

## Staff Rules:

Once you join the moderation team, your job is to keep the server active, and running well. If any user needs assistance, they would call !help or !mod. When they do so, a yellow box would pop up on the bottom left corner. Before clicking on it, make sure you:

* Pull entirely off of the road. Do **not** block the road in any way, or prevent roleplays from occurring.
* Get out of your car before teleporting. If you do not do so, you will only be ejected from the car, not teleported to the user.
* Try to complete the mod scene without help from a HR+ unless you need someone banned.
* Have a welcoming statement ready, such as "Hi! My name is (name), how may I assist you today?"

When on shift you should do as followed:

* No pursuing. This means if someone were to ram you, isn't using a livery, etc. you do <mark style="color:red;">**not**</mark> chase after them. Always have cruise lights on.
* You aren't part of roleplay. If a cop pulls you over, simply tell them you are staff and <mark style="color:red;">**not**</mark> involved in roleplay.
* No using random avatar items. You <mark style="color:red;">**cannot**</mark> use anything on your chest that covers the staff shirt. The staff shirt must be visible. This makes sure users don't mistake you as someone who is involved in roleplay.
* Use Complete SPaG (Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar). This helps users understand you more. <mark style="color:red;">**No**</mark> use slang, shortened sentences, using no punctuation, abbreviations, etc.
* Professionalism. This means <mark style="color:red;">**no**</mark> swearing, making inappropriate jokes, getting overly upset, or using caps.&#x20;
* Use a block avatar: You should be using a block avatar, with the R15 style, pictured below.

## Promotions:

Promotions are done every week on Friday, 12:00 PM (CST). If at any point you ask for promotion, you will not get promoted for that week. In order to get promoted you must:

* Have met the weekly quota (<mark style="color:blue;">5 hours</mark>)
* Have shown respect to HR+
* Have shown great professionalism and maturity.
* Have little to no infractions.

Please note: Even if you have hit all aspects above, this does not mean you will be promoted. You must also have been a staff for at least 1 week, been active with mod calls and discord checks, etc. If you don't get promoted, do not complain about it.
