## Information:

The image above depicts how the shoulder to shoulder should be setup every time. Failure to do so will result in moderation. You will need at least 3 staff members on duty, and you must get permission from HR+ to host a STS.



* The individual in charge of hosting must be the one responsible for positioning the cones and fences, ensuring that objects remain undisturbed during loading.
* While hosting, this person should be stationed on the sidewalk, while the other 2+ individuals supervise the members, ensuring compliance with the rules.
* The host's main focus should be on conveying load and bring messages, as well as using the :m commands. They should avoid engaging in activities like kicking or reprimanding others to stop talking.
*   To be eligible for hosting, the individual must possess the capability to switch between tabs and copy & paste messages. Without this ability, they cannot fulfill the role of the host.



## Messages:

:h Attention! Conclude your roleplays as an STS event is imminent! Ensure you are ready for teleportation.
